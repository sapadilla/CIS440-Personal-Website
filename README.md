###**Website Using BootStrap**  

####**Introduction**  
Using a screen responsive tool called Bootstrap I have created a website to show how a    
website can adjust depending on how big your screen is.  Bootstrap has really played a   
big role in responsive websites when veiwing website on mobil devices.  It makes it easier  
to navigate through a website by resizing the veiw to one screen so you don't have to scroll  
and try to find what you are looking for.  I also added a couple of things the tool has to  
offer such as warning text, and glyphs in the buttons.
